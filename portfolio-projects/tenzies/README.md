# 🎲 Tenzies Game App  

This project is a digital implementation of the Tenzies game, built as a learning exercise to understand React's **useState** hook and state management.

## 🌐 Live Demo  
[Play the Tenzies Game](https://tenzies-ap.netlify.app/)

## 🚀 How It Works  
- The app starts with a grid of dice showing random numbers.  
- When the user clicks "Roll," the dice continue to update until all values match.  
- Once all dice display the same value, the game stops, and the user can start a new game.  

## 🧠 Learning Objectives  
This project was designed to explore and practice key React concepts, including:  
1. **State Management**: Using the **useState** hook to control and update the state of each die and the overall game state.  
2. **Conditional Logic**: Managing the app's behavior when certain conditions (like all dice matching) are met.  
3. **Interactivity**: Exploring how user actions (clicks) can trigger state changes and influence the UI.  
4. **Pause/Update States**: Implementing logic to "pause" rolling when conditions are satisfied, offering insights into state-driven dynamic updates.  

## 💡 Reflection  
While this app deviates from the traditional Tenzies rules, it served as a practical playground for experimenting with React concepts in a hands-on way. The project helped solidify knowledge about managing component state and understanding how to manipulate it effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.  
- **CSS**: To style the app and make it visually appealing.  

## 🎯 Features  
- Dice rolling until all values match.  
- Reset functionality to start a new game.  
- Simple and interactive UI.
